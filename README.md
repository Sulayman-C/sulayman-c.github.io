### **Health Data Scientist | Economic Modeler | Quantitative Researcher**

I bridge the gap between complex health economic modeling and modern data science. With a background as a **Health Economist and Lead Modeller**, I specialised in turning multi-country epidemiological and seaprately, HIPPA compliant insurance data into actionable insights for national and global stakeholders, ranging from businesses to academic institutions to even the Irish Parliament.

Currently, I am expanding my technical toolkit through **Advanced Data Science & AI specialization** (SQL, Python, R) to bring the rigor of economic evaluation and understanding of health economics to scalable data products and analyses

This site showcases selected analytics projects completed as part of professional training and personal development in data science techniques.
